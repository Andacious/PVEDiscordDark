# PVEDiscordDark Javascript Modifications (DEPRECATED)

The Javascript modifications are now DEPRECATED. They will not recieve any updates. The rewrite has all of these changes integrated in a much safer and non-damaging way.

Please uninstall it by following the instructions below.

## Uninstallation
The install scripts back up the files they replace (the backups are placed in the same directory as the original file). Just remove the modified file and remove the '.bak' extension from the end of the backed up files.

The files that are modified are..  
* `/usr/share/pve-manager/js/pvemanager.js`
* `/usr/share/javascript/extjs/charts.js`
* `/usr/share/javascript/proxmox-widget-toolkit/proxmoxlib.js`
